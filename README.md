# Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent that Plays Connect 4
This project trains a neural network to play the game of Connect-4 at (hopefully) human level

## Prerequisites
- Have installed [python >= 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation steps
- Open a new terminal and go to the folder where you want to download the project
- Paste the following command: `git clone https://github.com/estebanmoscoso/connect_four.git`. 
If that doesn't work, check that you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed, 
or download the zip archive manually and descompress it.
- Enter the folder of the project `cd connect_four`
- Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv ./venv` and activate it with:
  - `source venv/bin/activate` in Linux / Mac
  - `.\venv\bin\activate.ps1` in Windows. Remember to enable permissions to execute scripts if asked to do so.
- Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## To run
Open a terminal and run the program with `python main.py`
